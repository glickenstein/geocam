Installing Explorer

  To install the development explorer, simply unzip the archive to a
  convenient location, such as the desktop.

Running Explorer

   Under Windows: Simply click on the desktop icon.

   Under Linux/Mac: 
   1) Open a terminal and move to the directory where
   you unzipped the archive. There, you will find a shell script
   named: explorer[Your OS Name][32 or 64 Bits]. 

   2) Make sure this script is executable by typing "chmod u+x
   explorer[Your OS Name][32 or 64 Bits]". 

   3) Then, execute the script by typing "./explorer..."

   Example Terminal Dialog (Mac OS X Machine):
   johnsmith@smithlaptop> cd ~/Desktop/explorermac
   johnsmith@smithlaptop> chmod u+x explorermac
   johnsmith@smithlaptop> ./explorermac
