This folder ("release") should be used to contain scripts that we will
use to make our release files. That is to say, this folder won't be
released; instead, the person in charge of creating the releases will
pick and choose scripts from this file when he/she is putting together
the data that will be released.

Steps for exporting the application:

0) Make a directory for your release. It should read something like:

[ App Name ][ OS Name ][ 32 or 64 ]

1) Set up an icon or shell script for running the application. This
depends on the operating system, and should be saved in the release
directory.

2) Copy the Data and lib directories of the project directly to your
release directory.

3) Go to File->Export->Runnable Jar. Save the jar into the release
directory.

4) Test your script/icon.

5) Add a "README" that explains how to run the program (ie, click the
icon or the shell commands to run the shell script).

6) Zip the release folder and email it to
glickenstein@math.arizona.edu to be posted to the web.
